        <p style="font-size:20pt;">A few aspects of Doom are based on the arguably most famous tabletop-roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons. As seen here, the design of the Cacodemon, a flying enemy found in the game, was taken from the cover of a first-edition D&D book, though the creature shown (referred to as an "ethereal dreadnought") doesn't actually exist in D&D.</p>
          
          <br>
          On top of that, the idea for the story of Doom, a base on Mars in the near future that's been overrun by demons due to an experiment gone awry, came from the end of a D&D campaign that the game designers had before the creation of Doom. A player that fans of Doom will recognize, John Romero, made a deal with a demon for immense power, but in turn gave the demon a powerful book that allowed the demon to summon hordes of demons from their plane of existence, wiping out their material world.

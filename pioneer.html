          <p3>Verticality:</p3><p style="font-size:20pt;", text-align= left>Most first-person games before Doom could only run on one surface; no stairs, platforms, or any changes in height at all. With Doom, not only could the player move from floor to floor, but enemies could exist on different levels as well! However, since the different heights was only really possible through graphical programming trickery, no walkable space could be placed over another.</p>

        <p style="font-size:20pt;">The original Doom pioneered many aspects of modern video games as we know them now, such as.... </p>
          <br>
            <p3>Deathmatches:</p3><p style="font-size:20pt;">Friends and coworkers could play together in LAN parties (basically a bunch of people with a bunch of computers in a room connected to the same server; the Xbox Live parties before Xbox Live) in multiplayer where they could compete for the most kills. Some businesses actually banned Doom from being played at the office due to workers using the computers to compete in deathmatches rather than working!</p>
          
          <br>
            <p3>Modding:</p3><p style="font-size:20pt;">Doom was built from the ground up with the idea of having users be able to create and share their own custom levels and enemies. These mods, or as they were called then, WADs (short for Where's All the Data files) could be as simple as a new map, or even entirely new games based on the Doom engine.</p>
